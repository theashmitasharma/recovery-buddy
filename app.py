        "source": "ASPS"
    },
    {
        "question": "When can I exercise after surgery?",
        "answer": "Light walking is usually encouraged within days of surgery. Most surgeons recommend waiting 4-6 weeks before any strenuous exercise. Always get clearance from your surgeon first.",
        "source": "Mayo Clinic"
    },
    {
        "question": "Is bruising normal?",
        "answer": "Yes! Bruising is very common and typically peaks around day 2-3 and then gradually fades over 1-3 weeks. Colors may change from purple to green to yellow as it heals.",
        "source": "Cleveland Clinic"
    },
    {
        "question": "When will swelling go down?",
        "answer": "Swelling peaks around day 2-3, then gradually decreases. Most swelling resolves within 2-4 weeks, but subtle swelling can persist for months. Final results may take 6-12 months.",

    },
    {
        "question": "Is it normal to feel emotional after surgery?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Post-surgical blues are very common due to anesthesia, pain medications, limited mobility, and the body's healing response. These feelings usually improve within 1-2 weeks.",
        "source": "Cleveland Clinic"

    {
        "question": "When should I call my surgeon?",
